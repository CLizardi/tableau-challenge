# Dashboards
From the Citi Bike data, I've created two corresponding dashboards to provide a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the data.

# User Analysis
The User Analysis section provides a comprehensive view of the Citi Bike ridership patterns, helping to inform decision-making related to the allocation of resources, pricing strategies, and infrastructure improvements. By understanding the demographics and behaviors of Citi Bike riders, bike share program managers and city planners can make informed decisions that will help to promote the growth and sustainability of the bike share program.e. 

## Start/End Time for User Types Line Graph
This visualization shows the distribution of bike trips by user type (subscriber vs. customer) over the course of a day. By using different colors to represent the two user types, we can see that subscribers tend to use the bike share program more heavily during peak commuting hours, while customers tend to use the program during off-peak hours and on weekends.

## User Types vs. Average Trip Duration Bar Graph
This visualization shows the average duration of bike trips for subscribers and customers. By using different colors to represent the two user types, we can see that customers tend to take longer trips than subscribers, which may reflect differences in how the two groups use the bike share program.

## Average Trip Duration by Gender Bar Graph
This visualization shows the average duration of bike trips by gender. By using different colors to represent male and female riders, we can see that female riders tend to take longer trips than male riders. This information can be useful for bike share program managers and city planners who are looking to target specific populations with bike share promotions or infrastructure improvements.

## Duration of Bike Trips and Age Line Graph
This visualization shows the relationship between the age of bike trip riders and the duration of their trips. By showcasing different ages, we can see that older riders tend to take longer trips than younger riders. This information can be useful for bike share program managers and city planners who are looking to optimize the system for different age groups, potentially by offering different pricing plans or incentives to encourage more frequent use among older riders.

# Station Analysis

This is an important aspect of understanding the ridership patterns of a bike share program. By looking at the starting and ending stations of each trip, we can gain insights into where the most popular bike trip starting and ending points are, and which areas of the city have the highest demand for bike sharing services. This may be able to help bike share program managers and city planners make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and how to improve the program.

The Start Station Names vs. Number of Records visualization is a bar chart that displays the number of trips that started at each Citi Bike station with at least 1000 entries. This visualization is useful for gaining insights into the popularity of different Citi Bike stations and the ridership patterns at these stations. The bar chart shows that there are several stations that have a much higher number of trips than others, such as Grove St PATH, Newport Pkwy, and Hamilton Park. These stations may be important hubs for the Citi Bike program, and understanding the ridership patterns at these stations can help bike share program managers and city planners make informed decisions about where to allocate resources and how to improve the program. Overrall, this visualization provides a useful summary of the ridership patterns at different Citi Bike stations, helping bike share program managers and city planners make informed decisions to improve the program and meet the needs of riders.

# Geographic Analysis

This visualization shows the geographic distribution of bike trips in Jersey City by mapping the starting and ending stations of each trip. By using different colors to represent the starting and ending stations, we can see that bike trips are concentrated in certain areas of the city, such as downtown and along the Hudson River waterfront.
